# RoboBall project
A Unity platformer-like game project.
You play as a recon drone that is scouting the remnants of an alien civilisation.
To test it, you will need to install unity. Once you open the project from the unity hub, it will build all the extra files and you can play with it in the editor.
**Please use the SampleScene under the FeatureDesignTest folder as a playground.**

## Gameplay
The player movement uses a physics based, ball motion to move the player around. The drone is weak and should generally avoid any combat. Using the tiny size to your advantage... you must use cover, go through vents, and use any means necessary to bypass your enemies and get back to your ship.

## Note from the developer
From this project, I've learned most of the basics of Unity. It started out as a small modeling project of the drone, then I decided to try and make a small game using the character. I learned various tools of the Unity game engine, such as their new input system, VFX Graph and Shader Graph, Animations for moving objects such as platforms, Projectile collision (by collider or by raycast), Baked Lighting with Reflection and Light Probes, ProBuilder, and more.
I'm stating the obvious, but of course, this project is nowhere near finished :).
I stopped developing it because of a lack of inspiration and ideas, mostly in terms of level design.
I was trying to go for a very tense, kind of spooky environment, but there are so many elements that go into designing a fun level. In terms of mood alone, there is lighting, environment props, sound effects, and properly managing the space. Then on top of that, you need to have areas that provide different levels of interactions and manage the pacing as well as the sense of progress (ex: a calm exploring phase that leads into a tense pursuit phase where enemies are trying to capture you).
I never really planned on learning sound design, but even without that, there are still so many aspects that need to be balanced to have good level design. 
Despite my creative block, this was still a great learning project that taught me a wide range of concepts and techniques applicable not only to Unity, but game development in general and perhaps software development as whole.
